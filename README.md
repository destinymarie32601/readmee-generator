# Readme Generator


## Description

This is a command line application using inquirer to easily and conveniently generate professional ReadMe files for developers. This project is started by entering "node index.js" in the terminal. The user will then be prompted to enter the necessary requirements for developing a professional ReadMe.After the user enters their Readme information in all of the prompts, the application will send the ReadMe to the ReadMe.md file, with a table of contents. This project solves the need to manually hardcode a ReadMe file, and is a very convenient addition and tool for developers. Throughout this project, I was able to further my knowledge on command line applications and inquirer.
